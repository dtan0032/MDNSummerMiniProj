# MDNSummerMiniProj

The aim of this project is to develop a neural network that will achieve at least 90% test accuracy with the concepts covered in the Monash Deep Neuron, Deep Learning Branch, Summer Trainings. 

## Dataset
The dataset used here is from Intel Image Classification, provided by Puneet Bansal. (https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)
The dataset contains around 25 000 images, each with the size of 150x150 pixels with 3 RGB channels, that each belong to 1 of 6 categories listed below.

Image Categories:
0 --> buildings
1 --> forest
2 --> glacier
3 --> mountain
4 --> sea
5 --> street

## Model
The model uses the layers in the following order:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

## Final Evaluation
The accuracy achieve from the model is % for train, % for test and % for prediciton.
